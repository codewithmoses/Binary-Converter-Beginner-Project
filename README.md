## Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly tool designed to help users convert decimal numbers (base 10) into binary numbers (base 2) and vice versa. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts, this project serves as an educational resource for understanding basic number system conversions and practicing front-end web development.

## Key Features

- **Icon Integration:** Font Awesome icons are used to enhance the visual presentation, particularly in warning and error messages.
- **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI:** The project is styled using Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components, facilitating rapid development and a consistent design language.

- **Binary Input:** Allows the user to input a binary number, which will be automatically converted to its decimal equivalent.

### 2. Error Handling
If the user enters an invalid binary number (a number containing digits other than 0 and 1), an error message with an informative icon is displayed.

### 3. Footer
The footer contains a dynamically generated copyright notice that automatically updates with the current year.
